## What is this?

***You can imagine this as my room, that has all kinds of shelves, drawers and posters in it.***

- Books that i've read, books that i haven't
- A shlef with trophies (Hall of Fame), A shelf with failed projects (Hall of Shame)
- A drawer full with short walkthrough's of challenges done previousely
- A drawer with long writeups of machines that have been pwned previousely
- A drawer with conclusions after reversing malware
- A drawer with developed exploits
- A poster with a methodology printed on it
- A poster with a mindset printed on it

## Whoami?
Just an individual, who won't stop until his the top of this hill.
